    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "### What is Git?\n",
    "Git is software for sharing code and version managing of code. There are many more comprehensive explanations avaible, such as [the git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) from the git website or [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git) from atlassian.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use git in the lab?\n",
    "* It facilitates development of software by mulitple people working on multiple different machines.\n",
    "    - tracking changes\n",
    "    - combining updates\n",
    "* It creates an online backup of your code and notes\n",
    "    - you can view your stuff from anywhere you have internet\n",
    "    - online copies can be public or private\n",
    "    - you can share updates on a project with your collaborators or PI\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is I-Python\n",
    "It's a sort of combination of code-terminal and code-editor all in one, with the ability to support markdown notes.  It runs in your browser, but it is powered by code on your hard-drive, such as your built in python distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use I-Python in lab?\n",
    "* document code snipets.\n",
    "* have text-searchable notes.  \n",
    "    - I tend to write notes in markdown anyway so this is a convienent markdown editor that integrates nicely into a web interface through git-hub.\n",
    "* document electronic images\n",
    "    - Most of equipment these days produce electronic images which are tedious unnecessary to print, cut and paste into a physical notebook. For example: gel-imager, Nano-drop, QPCR machine.\n",
    "    - A lot of our work invovles computationally processing images.  Grabbing screenshots of this process is much easier than making print outs, especially since we're already at the computer.\n",
    "    - What's not image data is largely genomic data, also something we tend to display and analyze on the computer, and which we can embed links to from the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Git\n",
    "* Download and install git from [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial: setting up a git-repository\n",
    "1. Create a folder called `tutorials`.  \n",
    "2. right click on the folder and select \"Git Bash here\" from the drop down menu.  \n",
    "    - (alternatively you can launch Git Bash as a program and cd to your folder\n",
    "    - `cd \"C:\\MyFolder\\tutorials\"`)\n",
    "3. Set up a handle to the remote directory\n",
    "    - `git remote add BoettigerLab https://github.com/BoettigerLab/tutorials.git`\n",
    "    - note you can use any individual word for the remote handle in place of BoettigerLab.\n",
    "4. Pull the contents of the remote server into your local folder\n",
    "    - `git remote pull BoettigerLab master`\n",
    "    - we grabbed the \"master\" branch. It is possible a project may have multiple branches, more on this later. \n",
    "    - open the  folder in your windows file browser and you should now see some files\n",
    "    <img src = \"./Images/gitInit.PNG\">\n",
    "5. Make some changes\n",
    "    - create a new text document in this folder and call it \"test.txt\"\n",
    "    - edit the document and enter the text \"My first version\"\n",
    "6. Commit your changes in the version manager (GUI based):\n",
    "    - right click the folder and select Git-GUI here.  (alternatively you can launch Git GUI and navigate to the folder)\n",
    "    - In the upper-left box you see a list of all files in the folder that are new (these are white) or have changed (these have a green icon, you should see none of these yet).  \n",
    "    - click the \"Stage Changed\" button or select the file \"text.txt\" and press \"Ctrl+T\" to stage this change\n",
    "    - enter a commit message such as \"my first addition\"\n",
    "    - select commit.  \n",
    "    <img src = \"./Images/GitGUIintro.PNG\">\n",
    "7. Revise and recommit\n",
    "    - open the file \"test.txt\"\n",
    "    - replace \"first\" with \"second\"\n",
    "    - open the git-GUI again and stage and commit this change\n",
    "7. To host your own repository, \n",
    "    - go to github.com and visit your user page.  \n",
    "    - select repositories, and select create new.\n",
    "    - give it a name, e.g. tutorials.\n",
    "    - return to your git bash, and add a handle to your new remote repository\n",
    "    - `git remote add MyRepo https://github.com/YourGitUserName/tutorials.git`\n",
    "    - push the repository to the online version\n",
    "    - `git push MyRepo master`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install python\n",
    "1. check to see if you already have python: open a command prompt, type in `python`, if python is installed (and inserted itself into Windows Environmental Variables), this should open a python terminal and tell you what version you are running.\n",
    "2. If you need python, I recommend installing the Anaconda build from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).  I'm still using 2.7 but one day I will convert to python 3.  Meanwhile I recommend 2.7.  \n",
