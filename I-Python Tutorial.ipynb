    "### What is I-Python\n",
    "It's a sort of combination of code-terminal and code-editor all in one, with the ability to support markdown and LaTeX.  It runs in your browser, but it is powered by code on your hard-drive, such as your built in python distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of more detailed descriptions about I-python online, which I recommend browsing: \n",
    "(Tutorial from i-Python Documentation)[http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html].  A quick google or youtube search should also return some more up to date results. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use I-Python in the lab?\n",
    "* document code snipets.\n",
    "* have text-searchable notes.  \n",
    "    - I tend to write notes in markdown anyway so this is a convienent markdown editor that integrates nicely into a web interface through git-hub.\n",
    "* document electronic images\n",
    "    - Most of equipment these days produce electronic images which are tedious unnecessary to print, cut and paste into a physical notebook. For example: gel-imager, Nano-drop, QPCR machine.\n",
    "    - A lot of our work invovles computationally processing images.  Grabbing screenshots of this process is much easier than making print outs, especially since we're already at the computer.\n",
    "    - What's not image data is largely genomic data, also something we tend to display and analyze on the computer, and which we can embed links to from the web.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Install python\n",
    "1. check to see if you already have python: open a command prompt, type in `python`, if python is installed (and inserted itself into Windows Environmental Variables), this should open a python terminal and tell you what version you are running.\n",
    "2. If you need python, I recommend installing the Anaconda build from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).  I'm still using 2.7 but one day I will convert to python 3.  Meanwhile I recommend 2.7.  \n",
    "3. Note to lab users: python is already installed on BoettigerServer. \n",
    "4. Anaconda comes `i-python` as one of the built in packages in Anaconda, so it's installed to, along with several packages we'll use a lot, such as `numpy`,`matplotlib`, and `scipy`.  It also installs `pip`, which makes it much easier to install other common packages later. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Tutorial: Intro to I-Python\n",
    "### Launching I-python\n",
    "I recommend running I-python in a folder where you can store all your notes.\n",
    "Create a new folder (something like `C:\\code\\my-notes`), then open a command prompt and write (`jupyter notebook \"C:\\code\\my-notes\"`). The quotes are only strictly necessary if you have spaces in the file path.  Then select new notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring a start-up script\n",
    "There are probably some common packages you use a lot, and perhaps some custom libraries you've written that you also use on a standard basis.  Rather than beginning each session with a long string of `import x y z...`s we can write a little startup script that we will run each time to do this all in one step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply write all your commands into a python file like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # AlistairStartup.py\n",
    "\n",
    "    # import some commonly used libraries with some commonly used shorthands:\n",
    "    import sys,os,glob\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    import scipy as sp\n",

    "    from IPython.display import clear_output\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Find my python-functions folder, based on the file structure, and add it to the path:\n",
    "    dir_file = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n",
    "    python_functions_folder =  os.path.dirname(dir_file)+os.sep+'python-functions'+os.sep+'python-functions-library'\n",
    "    sys.path.append(python_functions_folder)\n",
    "    print 'Added to path: '+python_functions_folder\n",
    "    GUIs_folder =  os.path.dirname(dir_file)+os.sep+'python-functions'+os.sep+'GUIs'\n",
    "    sys.path.append(GUIs_folder)\n",
    "    print 'Added to path: '+GUIs_folder\n",
    "\n",
    "    # import a few of my function libraries from my python-functions-folder\n",
    "    import GeneralTools as gt # my general tools\n",
    "    import StormAnalysisAdditions as saa # library for STORM analysis\n",
    "    import LibraryConstruction as lc # library for handling fasta files and other things in library building\n",

    "    print 'daoSTORM path='+daoSTORM\n",

    "To run this file we just write: \n",
    "`%run AlistairStartup.py` into a code cell of the i-python notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding figures to the notebook\n",
    "We can also easily added images to the notebook.  As I want these images I add to display on git-hub as well as on my local machine, I put them in an Images folder inside my notebook folder, and make the whole notebook folder a git repository.  If you do this I recommend trying to keep the images small.  Large images you can save in another folder that will display locally, but won't be available online (and won't clog up your git repos).  \n",
    "\n",
    "To add a figure we just write: \n",
    "        `<img src = \"./Images/myPicture.PNG\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `\"./Images/myPicture.PNG\"`  is the filepath to the image.  It can be a full filepath or referenced relative to the working directory where the notebook is running from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: github is sensitive to the case, even though the local I-Python is not.  Consequently if your file is a `.png` or a `.PNG` matters as far as whether or not it will display correctly.\n",
